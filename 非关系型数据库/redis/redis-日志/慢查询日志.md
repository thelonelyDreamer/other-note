## 一、慢查询日志配置

### 1.1 配置文件配置

```shell
# The Redis Slow Log is a system to log queries that exceeded a specified
# execution time. The execution time does not include the I/O operations
# like talking with the client, sending the reply and so forth,
# but just the time needed to actually execute the command (this is the only
# stage of command execution where the thread is blocked and can not serve
# other requests in the meantime).
#
# You can configure the slow log with two parameters: one tells Redis
# what is the execution time, in microseconds, to exceed in order for the
# command to get logged, and the other parameter is the length of the
# slow log. When a new command is logged the oldest one is removed from the
# queue of logged commands.

# The following time is expressed in microseconds, so 1000000 is equivalent
# to one second. Note that a negative number disables the slow log, while
# a value of zero forces the logging of every command.
slowlog-log-slower-than 10000

# There is no limit to this length. Just be aware that it will consume memory.
# You can reclaim memory used by the slow log with SLOWLOG RESET.
slowlog-max-len 128
```

### 1.2 命令行配置

```bash
config set slowlog-log-slower-than 10000
config set slowlog-max-len 128
```

## 二、满查询日志相关命令

### 1.1 查询日志

```bash
slowlog get
1) 1) "6"				# 日志唯一标识
   2) "1645691548" 		# 命令执行时的unix时间戳 
   3) "115452"			# 命令执行时的微秒数
   4) 1) "sort"			# 命令极其参数
      2) "numbers"

   5) "120.242.251.239:42467"  	# 命令执行的ip 和端口
   6) ""						# 未知
```

### 1.2 清空日志

```
SLOWLOG RESET
```
